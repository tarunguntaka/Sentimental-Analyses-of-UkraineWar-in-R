# Conclusions
- As per the data, most of the tweets are representing negativity because of the ongoing Russian-Ukraine war. It is also reflected in the NRC emotional chart where fear, trust, and anger have higher frequencies compared to others. The fear is due to the missiles shelling on Ukraine where trust is they may have belief in world peace. 

- The primary source of negativity not only comes from Ukraine war, many people around the world are concerned about their countries as Russia could extend the war beyond Ukraine and invade other countries. Also in the US, many people are against Biden, supporting the Trump administration. Not only in the US, but we can see many people from other countries are also supporting the trump administration. 

- The Supporting word is used most often because many people are coming forward in order to help refugees and provide sufficient fundraising for them. 

# Discussion
-   Since this data is collected in real-time, the analyses may differ every day according to several factors. Although we can see many of these tweets show that people are concerned about the war. The analysis is also limited in that the project focuses on tweets that are in the English language and thus fails to capture possible topics and sentiments of tweets in other languages. Future research should collect data over a period that helps to evaluate the exact situation.
